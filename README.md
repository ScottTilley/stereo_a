STEREO-A Inferior Conjunction 2023

Archive of STEREO-A low rate deep space beacon data.

Data files are indicated by the .cadu extension.  The Jupyter-notebook scripts convert these to raw .bin data files for use in the analysis.

Time of file IQ start in YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS UTC, it takes a few frames before the decoder kicks in or the signal gets strong enough so there is an offset between the spacecraft clock and the time the IQ file file started and the data gets decoded.  The analysis scripts provide timestamp details from the spacecraft itself.

The antenna used is a 66cm prime focus dish.
